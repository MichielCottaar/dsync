Syncing data across multiple machines (ssh) and backups
This makes a lot of assumptions about where data is stored and is not recommended for general use.

# Installation
```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/MichielCottaar/dsync.git
```

After installation run `dsync` to see your options.

## Releasing new versions
- Run `bump2version` (install using `pip install bump2version`)
